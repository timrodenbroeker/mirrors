"Mirrors" is my reaction to Lin Kes video work "Fly Like Me". The series of 3 web-based, webcam-applications puts the user in a digital situation in which he himself looks at his own mouse cursor. Thevideo-signal is interpreted and generatively visualized differently in each of the individual works. This creates interesting moments that can be saved at the click of the mouse.
