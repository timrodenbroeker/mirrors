With this series of generative artworks I bring Gottfired JÃ¤ger's "Bildspiegelmontagen" into a digital space that can be visited with any common web browser. Basically, i've adopted the artistic principle of mirror images lined up side by side and placed it into in a three-dimensional setting. My three variants of the same generative system are interactive and can be controlled and explored with the mouse. The motifs on the mirror surfaces are based on images of plants selected by a random algorithm. With one click, individual, high-resolution stills from the complex system can be saved as an image.
