This project was created in summer 2020 during my master studies at the University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld (study field "Digital Media and Experiment"). Complementary to the digital works of the web-based exhibition "In This Layered World All Perception Is Real" of the Bielefelder Kunstverein we were commissoned to develop artistic "reactions". So the aim was to interpret the works in the exhibition and to respond to them artistically. 

During this project, I dealt with three artists and their works: Lin Ke, Sara Ortmeyer and Gottfried JÃ¤ger. This is the place where i share my results.
