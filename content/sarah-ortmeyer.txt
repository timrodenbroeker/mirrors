The idea of Sarah Ortmeyer to reinterpret digital artifacts or emojis with analogue tools fascinated me a lot. In response to this, I developed a series of programs that show motifs and text fragments from digital open access archives as a template next to a digital canvas on which the user can paint with the mouse. Each program shows different groups of motifs and also the brushes vary. In addition, there is a gallery page on which selected works are exhibited.
