## Tim Rodenbröker - "Gottfried Jäger Remixed"

A series of three-dimensional, browser-based works that reinterpret Gottfried Jäger's examination of basic principles of programmed design. Reactions "1" and "4" refer directly to Jäger's "pinhole structures" and "Wellenfelder" and translate the formal principles of these works into an three-dimensional space. "2" and "3" are complex variations of the "Rotationsprogramme".
