"Mirrors" is my reaction to Lin Ke's video work "Fly Like Me". The series of 3 web-based, generative mirrors puts the user in a digital situation in which he himself looks at his own mouse cursor. The webcam signal is interpreted and generatively visualized differently in each of the individual works. This creates fascinating moments that can be saved at the click of the mouse.
